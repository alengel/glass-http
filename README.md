# glass-http

This repository is a Glass application that connects to a web server. Once a user has taken a picture or used a voice command of a product, it will use Camfind to determine the product. It sends the string to the web server (see below) and waits for the HTML cards to be returned. 

This application works only together with it's counterpart on Google Glass, which can be found here: https://github.com/alengel/glass-node

<b>How to use this repository:</b>
